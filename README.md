ETSOO PDF Generation Library / 亿速思维 PDF 生成库

# Background
We were very confused about whether to reinvent the wheel (have learned a lot from others for sure), but in the end we had to choose to do so because of the popular components (https://github.com/itext/itextsharp [Deprecated], https://github.com/empira/PDFsharp, https://github.com/QuestPDF/QuestPDF) all have more or less flaws, such as the output file is too large, or the code is difficult to maintain. We chose to start with NET 8 because maturing a set of code requires a process and years of improvement.

# Features
- The library is licensed under MIT and permanently free.
- Can easily generate PDF file from HTML content.
- The output file size is as small as possible.
- Keep the code stupid simple, easy to read and understand.
